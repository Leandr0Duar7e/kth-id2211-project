--- CONCLUSION ---
Based on the comprehensive analysis of political communities on Reddit from 2008 to 2019:

Louvain algorithm consistently outperforms Spectral Clustering across all metrics.

Political communities have become more distinct (higher modularity) over time,
suggesting increased polarization in the Reddit political landscape.
